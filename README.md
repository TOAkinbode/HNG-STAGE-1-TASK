### HNG 12 Stage 1 Task: Data Preparation and Visualization

I completed the first stage of the HNG 12 task, where I prepared raw marketing data for analysis. My goal was to improve data quality, SEO, and readability.

Here's how I achieved it:

### Data Cleaning in Power BI:

1. Promoted headers for better organization
2. Changed data types for accuracy
3. Extracted specific text ranges for focused insights
4. Removed unnecessary column for clutter-free data
5. Replaced values for consistency
6. Eliminated duplicates for unique data points

### Data Quality Check:

I verified my data quality under the View tab and achieved a 100% error-free score!

### Data Visualization:

I created informative visuals using Power BI's report view, which are attached in the media section below.

This task demonstrated the importance of data preparation and visualization in extracting valuable insights. I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects!
